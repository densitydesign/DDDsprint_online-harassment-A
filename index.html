                We investigated the intersection of Online Harassment and AI, addressing specific tools, prevalence, and accessibility. Our study also analyzed the language used in online harassment discussions, identifying prevalent words across platforms. We explored platforms with a higher concentration of such words and delved into specific communities fostering their extensive use. This comprehensive approach illuminates the multifaceted dimensions of Online Harassment and its connection to artificial intelligence and synthetic media.

                    Back to Colab, we did a lemmatization in order to make the wording.

Subsequently, we extended our analysis to gauge the accessibility of these tools by delineating their pricing structures.

A systematic collection and analysis of all comments related to the topic were conducted, extracting the words utilized by individuals to articulate their perspectives. Subsequently, these words were visually represented in a graphic, their positions signifying prevalence on each platform. Words positioned at the center of the graphic indicated commonality across all three platforms, providing insights into the shared discourse surrounding online harassment.

The topics of the subreddits range from news and politics in general to information about entertainment and technology.

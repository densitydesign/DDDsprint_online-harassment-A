                We investigated the intersection of Online Harassment and AI, addressing specific tools, prevalence, and accessibility. Our study also analyzed the language used in online harassment discussions, identifying prevalent words across platforms. We explored platforms with a higher concentration of such words and delved into specific communities fostering their extensive use. This comprehensive approach illuminates the multifaceted dimensions of Online Harassment and its connection to artificial intelligence and synthetic media.

                    The tools we used to scrape content online were mainly from <a href="https://console.apify.com/">Apify</a> and <a href="https://webscraper.io/">Webscraper.io</a>
                    Scraping data from a generic “Online harassment” query we obtained: </br>

                        <li>10.000 elements from Reddit</li>

                        <li>270 elements from Tiktok</li>
                        <li>100 elements from Threads</li>

After transforming the file in a .docx we uploaded the file on <a href="https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/">AntConc</a>
                    The software finds the word before and after, counting and making groups (Trinomes) that were discarded in our process, focusing on single words and their density.
                    Back to Colab, we did a lemmatization in order to make the wording.

                Our initial undertaking involved a comprehensive mapping of the diverse array of AI tools available online, categorizing them based on their respective types, encompassing text, image, 3D video, audio, code, business, and other classifications. Subsequently, we extended our analysis to gauge the accessibility of these tools by delineating their pricing structures.

                Following that, the mapping process began with an exploration of discussions regarding "online harassment" across Threads, TikTok, and Twitter.
